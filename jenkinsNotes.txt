######## Jenkins ########

#### Jenkins Installation:
- Jenkins can be installed on various operating systems including Windows, macOS, and Linux distributions like Ubuntu, CentOS, and Red Hat.
- Make sure to have atleast 50 gb storage space for jenkins installation.
- using the below script resize the disk and logical volumes accordingly before installing jenkins.
        #!/bin/bash

        #resize disk from 20GB to 50GB
        growpart /dev/nvme0n1 4

        lvextend -L +10G /dev/mapper/RootVG-varVol # cause /var is where jenkins data will be stored
        lvextend -L +10G /dev/mapper/RootVG-rootVol # cause / is where jenkins will be installed
        lvextend -l +100%FREE /dev/mapper/RootVG-homeVol # cause /home is where user data will be stored

        xfs_growfs /
        xfs_growfs /var
        xfs_growfs /home

- For CentOS/RHEL based systems, follow the steps below to install Jenkins:
    -   sudo yum install -y wget # use wget or curl -o
    -   sudo wget --secure-protocol=TLSv1_2 -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo \
            https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo
            or
        curl -o /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo \
            https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo    
        rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key    
        sudo yum upgrade
        # Add required dependencies for the jenkins package
        sudo yum install fontconfig java-21-openjdk -y
        sudo yum install jenkins -y
        sudo systemctl daemon-reload
        sudo systemctl enable jenkins
        sudo systemctl start jenkins    

#### Unlocking Jenkins
- When you first access a new Jenkins controller, you are asked to unlock it using an automatically-generated password.

- Browse to http://localhost:8080 (or whichever port you configured for Jenkins when installing it) and wait until the Unlock Jenkins page appears.    

- From the Jenkins console log output, copy the automatically generated alphanumeric password (between the 2 sets of asterisks).

    Note:

    - The command: sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword will print the password at console.

    - If you are running Jenkins in Docker using the official jenkins/jenkins image you can use sudo docker exec ${CONTAINER_ID or CONTAINER_NAME} cat /var/jenkins_home/secrets/initialAdminPassword to print the password in the console without having to open an interactive shell inside the container.



#### Installing Jenkins agents on remote nodes:
- To install jenkins agent on remote node, follow the steps below:
    - Login to jenkins master node UI.
    - Go to Manage Jenkins -> Manage Nodes and Clouds -> New Node.
    - Enter the node name, select "Permanent Agent" and click OK.
    - Fill in the required details like number of executors, remote root directory, labels, usage, launch method etc.
    - For launch method, select "Launch agents via SSH".
    - Enter the remote node's hostname or IP address, credentials (username and password or private key) and port (default is 22).
    - Click "Save" to create the node.
    - Jenkins will now attempt to connect to the remote node via SSH and install the agent software.
    - Once the agent is successfully installed, it will appear as "online" in the Jenkins nodes list and will be ready to accept jobs.

    Note: Make sure that the remote node has Java installed and is reachable from the Jenkins master node.
    - For our agent we  need to run the following script to install necessary packages and tools.
        #!/bin/bash

        #resize disk from 20GB to 50GB
        growpart /dev/nvme0n1 4

        lvextend -L +10G /dev/mapper/RootVG-varVol
        lvextend -L +10G /dev/mapper/RootVG-rootVol
        lvextend -l +100%FREE /dev/mapper/RootVG-homeVol

        xfs_growfs /
        xfs_growfs /var
        xfs_growfs /home

        # This is mandatory, nodejs installtion will break SSH if we dont update these packages
        dnf update -y openssl\* openssh\* -y
        yum install java-21-openjdk -y

        dnf module disable nodejs -y
        dnf module enable nodejs:20 -y
        dnf install nodejs -y

#### Writing a Jenkins file:
- A Jenkinsfile is a text file that contains the definition of a Jenkins Pipeline and is checked into source control.
- It is written using the Groovy programming language and defines the stages, steps, and other aspects of the pipeline.
- A simple Jenkinsfile example:
    ```
    pipeline {
        agent any   
        stages {
            stage('Build') {
                steps {
                    echo 'Building...'
                }
            }
            stage('Test') {
                steps {
                    echo 'Testing...'
                }
            }
            stage('Deploy') {
                steps {
                    echo 'Deploying...'
                }
            }
        }
    }

    ```
- It should be written in a file named "Jenkinsfile" and placed in the root directory of the source code repository.    

## Install plugins:
    - Git Plugin
    - stage view plugin

#### 

## Pre build:
  prebuild steps are used to perform any setup or initialization tasks before the main build process begins. This can include tasks such as checking out source code from a version control system, setting up environment variables, installing dependencies, or preparing build artifacts. Pre-build steps help ensure that the build environment is properly configured and ready for the actual build process to take place.
    - Install "Pre Build Task" plugin in jenkins master.
    - In the job configuration, scroll down to the "Build Environment" section and check the "Pre Build Task" option.
    - Click on the "Add" button to add a new pre-build task.
    - In the "Command" field, enter the script or command that you want to run
        before the build starts. This can be a shell script, batch file, or any other command that is supported by your build environment.
## Build stage:
    The build stage in Jenkins is where the actual compilation, packaging, and building of the application takes place. This stage typically involves executing build scripts or commands that are specific to the programming language or framework being used. The build stage may include tasks such as compiling source code, running unit tests, generating build artifacts (e.g., JAR files, WAR files, Docker images), and performing code analysis or static code checks. The goal of the build stage is to produce a deployable artifact that can be used in subsequent stages of the CI/CD pipeline, such as testing and deployment.
        - In the job configuration, scroll down to the "Build" section.
        - Click on the "Add build step" button and select the appropriate build step for your project (e.g., "Execute shell", "Invoke Ant", "Invoke Gradle", etc.).
        - In the build step configuration, enter the commands or scripts that will perform the build process for your application. This may include compiling code, running tests, generating artifacts, etc.
        - Save the job configuration.
## Post build:
    Post-build steps in Jenkins are actions that are executed after the main build process has completed. These steps are typically used to perform tasks such as archiving build artifacts, sending notifications, publishing reports, or triggering downstream jobs. Post-build steps help ensure that the results of the build are properly managed
